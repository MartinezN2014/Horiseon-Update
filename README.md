# Horiseon Update

## Description

I updated Horiseon index.html and style.css files.
I started by changing the semantic elements in the index.html file.
I did this because originally nearly all the semantics were just a "div" element and it made everything very confusing so I tried replacing all the "div" elements with a more accurate semantic element. Since the div elements got changed I also had to go into the style.css file and make some corrections in order for the style sheet to still work. Lastly there was an image placed in the style sheet that I removed and placed in the index.html file and gave it its class attribute so the image kept its size.
